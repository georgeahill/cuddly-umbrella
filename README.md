# COMP3211

This is made up of 3 APIs (2 internal, 1 external) and a client! This README is on running all services simultaneously. To see info about individual services, please refer to the READMEs in the individual folders. 

## To run and build

Ensure Docker is installed and the docker daemon is running, then cd into this directory and run `docker-compose up`. The client can be accessed at `localhost:80`; the other services are not accessible when deploying with docker-compose.
